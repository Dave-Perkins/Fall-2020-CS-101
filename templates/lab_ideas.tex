% MAKE SURE TO SAVE THIS LAB IN A LABS FOLDER
% LISTS/FOR LOOP QUESTIONS -------------------------------------------
 Random lab concepts \& questions.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Why does the code  below throw an error and what do the brackets do? (Hint: Try printing out {\consolas x} and see how that compares to the length of {\consolas colorList}).\\\\
    \colorbox{lightgray}{\parbox{.88\textwidth}{\consolas colorList = ["blue","green","red","purple","orange","yellow","black"]\\
    listLen = len(colorList)\\
    \\
   for x in range(70):\\
   \hspace*{6mm} print(colorList[x])}}\\\\\\\\\\


%%%%%%%% I/O QUESTIONS %%%%%%%%
\item Do the each of the following in your shell window.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Type {\consolas my\_input = input("Enter a number: ")}.
\item Type your favorite number and hit enter.
\item Type {\consolas my\_input}. What does this give you? What type is {\consolas my\_input}?
\item Convert {\consolas my\_input} to an {\consolas int}.
\end{enumerate}

% FIND A TEXT FILE FOR THEM TO DOWNLOAD AND PUT IN THE SAME FOLDER AS THE LAB SO THEY CAN PRACTICE OPENING/READING FILES
\item In your editor, type the following lines of code.
\begin{center}
\colorbox{lightgray}{\parbox{.6\textwidth}{\consolas\\
file = open("filename.txt")\\
text = file.read()\\
print("TEXT:", text)\\
caps = text.upper()\\
print("CAPS:", caps)\\
lowers = text.lower()\\
print("LOWERS:", lowers)}}
\end{center}
\begin{enumerate}
\item What is {\consolas text}? What is the type of {\consolas text}?\\\\
\item What is the difference between {\consolas text} and {\consolas caps}? What does {\consolas .upper()} do?\\\\
\item What is the difference between {\consolas text} and {\consolas lowers}? What does {\consolas .lower()} do?\\\\
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

I was chilling on the porch the other day when I heard a song come on the radio.
I was feeling really great and I’m pretty sure I looked super awesome because Jennifer walked in and almost died. 
Seriously, they laughed for almost twelve minutes!
This time every year I'm hyper all the time because I get really exciting thinking about holiday cookies. 
That’s why I was sitting at the porch: I was really hoping Cassandra would come by and give me at least 4 pieces of holiday sugar cookies!
